the usual flow of data  -> the complexity of it -> one challenge in data lineage
use case of data lineage: 
    migration of applications and reporst
    assurance of integrity in reports
Overview of data quality:
  Different types of data:
    The concept of manufacturing products
      Raw data item
      Component data item
      Information product
    Based on the structure
      Structured data
      Semi-structured data
      Unstructured data
  Data dimensions are attributes of data quality that can, when measured correctly, indicate
  the overall quality level of data
  Demensions are highly context dependent and their relevancy and importance can vary between
  organization and types of data
  The most common dimensions are completeness, timeliness, and accuracy, consistency and accessibility
DQ in IoT:
  Characteristics
    Uncertain, erroneous and noisy
    Voluminuous and distributed
    Smooth variation
    Continuous
    Correlation
    Periodicity
    Markovian behavior
  Data quality: how well data meet the requirements of data consumers
  Exist a plethora of DQ dimensions (both domain-agnostic and domain-specific) due to the
  fact that data are a represenation of various aspect of the real world phenomena
  Categories of DQ dimension
    Instrinsic
    Contextual
    Representational
    Accessibility
DQ and IoT:
  Popular DQ dimensions
    Accuracy
    Timeliness
    Completeness
    Data volume
  Methods used to measure DQ in IoT
    Measurements between techniques, sources or defined attributes
    Measurements with a reference
    Devices or algorithms validation
    Meaasurement within time interval
    Measurement of presence
    Process observations
    Log files review

  Inference requests may follow uncertai execution paths
  For sophisticated applications, multiple DNNs may be involved in the process where all these
  DNNs are chained or orchestrated into complex data flow graph, represented by a direct acyclic
  grap (DAG), to process the input data step by step
  For microservices, request processing typically follows a deterministic dataflow-graph, instead
  of one with conditional execution paths as in inference serving systems
Automated ensemble
  Heterogeneity of DNNs,
  Edge computing platforms
  Resource constraint in edge computing
Application of ML for IoT
  Problem
    Heteregenous data
SAC
  Problem
    Only work in certain scenario
Problem with MLaas:
  ML consumers need to know about the confidence of the ML model as it can endanger
  peoples' lives, such as e-health monitoring where uncertain decisions cannot be allowed 
  or tolerated in the e-heal domain (Data quality in IoT)
  E-health applications are among the most critical IoT applications considering
  the human life factor involved and, as a consequence, do not tolerate uncertainty in DQ (DQ in IoT)
  The complexity of the pipeline
Benefits from data lineage
  tracing down the problems -> can upgrade the model to fit the new data distribution
  optimizing QoA4ML when the contract is violated, faster to detect root cause
  data in IoT is periodic, we can combine violation into a batch for tomorrow resolution
  scenario for a human face validation IoT devies
