Given-before-new principle
Four topical progression patterns
  Constant topic: use the same topic in a series of sentences
  Step-wise topic: an element of the comment of the previous sentinces becomes the topic of the next
  Hypertopic: first sentince introduces a general topic following by sentences form sub-topics
  Split topic: two or more elements of the comment in the first sentence are picked up as the topic of the following sentences
Light-before-heavy principle : start the sentence with a short, simple subject and place long, compilcated concepts after the verbs
Repairing problems
   Use synonymous repetition
   Use pronouns (it, they / this these)
   Use topicalising phrases
   Use the active-passive shift
   Use the equative shift
   Use the animate-inanimate shift
   Use the personal-impersonal shift
   Use introductory it (dummy subject)
   Use existential there (dummy subject)
